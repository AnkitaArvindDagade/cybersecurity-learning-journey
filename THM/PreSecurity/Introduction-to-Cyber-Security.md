 Introduction to Cyber Security
This module from the Pre-Security Path on TryHackMe introduced me to the fundamentals of cybersecurity. It explained the two main areas of the field—Offensive and Defensive Security, and gave insights into various cybersecurity career paths.

 Key Topics Learned
Offensive Security
Involves breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.

Main goal is to think like an attacker to discover weaknesses before malicious actors do.

Defensive Security
Focuses on protecting systems from attacks, detecting intrusions, and responding to them effectively.

Includes building secure systems and monitoring them using security tools and policies.

Security Operations Center (SOC)
A team of cybersecurity professionals that monitors the network and systems to detect malicious activity.

Key focus areas include vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, policy violations, and network intrusions.

Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)
Involves analyzing cyberattacks after they happen, and investigating how they occurred.

Includes malware analysis and threat intelligence.

Career Roles
Offensive: Penetration Tester, Red Teamer

Defensive: Security Engineer, SOC Analyst, Malware Analyst, Incident Responder, Forensics Examiner
